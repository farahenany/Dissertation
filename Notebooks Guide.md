# Dissertation
This repository will display the code used for my dissertation in the analysis of "customer base global retail bank" data set availble on kaggle. 
Methods used to segment and analyse the market are factor analysis, k-protoypes, and CLV model (TIRS).

The notebooks in this repositiory contain all the code used for the analysis. The "Data Cleaning" notebook displays the data cleaning and preprocessing for the data. There are different versions of the data used for each analysis method. 

The notebooks for factor analysis contain the factor analysis code for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.

The "Clustering" notebook contains the successful code for the K-prototypes clustering implemented and the trial implmentations of BIRCH clustering and K-means clustering.

The "TIRS" notebook contains the code for the adaptive RFM model for CLV segmentation.

The "Lorenz curve for UK" notebook contains the code for the generation of the lorenz curve sorted by proposition.

The "Lorenz curve for UK by CLV segmentation" notebook contains the code for the generation of the lorenz curve sorted by CLV segments.

The "Discriminant Anlaysis" notebook contains the code for the implementation of discrimiant analysis.
The "Supervised Learning" notebook contains the code for the failed implementations of the supervised learning models.
